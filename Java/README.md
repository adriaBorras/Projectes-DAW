## Java projects

Here are some projects Iâ€™ve made while learning Java:



In chronological order:
- Fortnite Zero build 
    - Loops.
- Battleships 
    - Function and arrays.
- Connect 4 
    - Functions and arrays.
- El Lodazal 
    - Class and objects.
- RPG Adventure 
    - All the above.
- Dungeon generator 
    - Deep first search with recursive backtracking algorithm.
- TPV Fruiteria
    - CRUD graphic interface with MYsql database.

## Disclaimer

This projects use ANSI codes for their output (TPV Fruiteria is an exception). Make sure to use an IDE that fully supports them, such as VS Code. 
Netbeans for example, does not.
