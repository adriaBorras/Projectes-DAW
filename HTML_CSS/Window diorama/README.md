## Window diorama

Interactive diorama. HTML and CSS only.

The main features are grids, perspective and animations.
This was made during a week that I was sick, time to practice!

Origin points of objects are a mess! A thing to keep in mind for the next project, a bit more planning will not hurt.

Some kind of control panel for the diorama, unfinished. Was meant to trigger some actions, like changing night and day or triggering some animations.
